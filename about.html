      <p>An office is a project that seeks to build a transnational network of practices fomenting collaboration and cooperation between several artists, cultural workers and the Jakarta based collective Gudskul. By subverting and appropriating the elaborate capitalist strategies of offices, be they federal or corporate, we are developing an adaptive hybrid platform (presential/online, activism/art) to form long-term relations. Operating within diverse urban and rural spaces, contexts, and histories, and between the Global North and South, will allow us to address social and ecological urgencies by getting involved locally and sustainably, avoiding short time interactions that so often end up being exploitative in nature. The project will unfold via office ‚ÄúDepartments‚Äù that engage in the co-facilitation of workshops, a ‚ÄúTeambuilding Festival‚Äù, a publication, and an exhibition. We are invited by ruangrupa and Gudskul ecosystem in Jakarta to further develop these exchanges as a space for collaborations between activists and cultural practitioners across borders and differences.</p>

      <h2>We as a group</h2>
      <p>We are a diverse group of artists, writers, curators, designers, and other creatives and cultural workers coming from different places in the world, including Austria, Azerbaijan, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, and Russia.
As an interdisciplinary and international artistic and curatorial
group, we are gathered around our shared interest in collaboration
and practices that allow for differences within them. Our first
encounter happened in the International Summer Academy
Salzburg (2021) at the course ‚ÄúBecoming Lumbung‚Äô‚Äô hosted by the
Indonesian art collective ruangrupa. At the end of the course we
were invited to Gudskul in the spring of 2022, and since then, we
have kept in touch through bi-weekly online meetings.
What holds us together is our different interlaced needs of
learning, making, sharing, listening, and developing further our
varied practices, as well as our affective entanglements with
each other and our collaborators/audiences. We are a group
that is individually and collectively researching ways to connect
and to bridge differences, continuing to grow from the ideas and
practices of the community accumulation system of lumbung that
we have learned about during our time in Salzburg with ruangrupa.
In facing various challenges of finding ways to collaborate, to
work together as a group, we were inspired by the work The Office
of Inner Emigration by Sophie Stadler, one of the group members,
and decided to take the concept of ‚Äúoffice‚Äù as an overarching
structure for our upcoming residency at Gudskul in Jakarta,
Indonesia.
Gudskul is an ecosystem of collective practices and an art
school initiated by ruangrupa. It holds a very important trajectory
with a vast experience in radical forms of pedagogy and collective
practices. These have allowed them to develop exciting artistic
tools and a unique learning environment from their specific
interrelations.
As a group, we are interested in developing a long-term
relationship and to learn/participate in the Gudskul ecosystem.
More specifically, we are interested in developing an exchange
with collectives such as Serrum, focused on research in art
pedagogy, Grafis Huru Hara, a collective dedicated to exploring</p>
